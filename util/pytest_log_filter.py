This file allows to filter a pytest test report such that only the errors, failures etc. are outputted.
This means that the part of the report regarding the passed tests and on the current progress are filtered out.

Run the script by calling it with as first (and only) input argument the location of a text based file where the pytest test report can be found.

def filter_test_log(log_txt, filter_type='summary'):
    """
    Filters a log file to only include the parts with a failure warning etc.
    Text regarding progress and passed tests are excluded.
    If the output log is too long the middle part of the logged is not returned.

    :param log_txt: (str) String with the log of a single test file.
    :param filter_type: (str) The type of message that we want to filter out. Optional, default 'summary'.
        'summary' returns the short test summary output, and 'warning' returns the warnings summary.
    :return: (str) filtered log, returns None if there is nothing interesting in log_txt

    Example of filtering:
    This function expects a pytest test report of single test file as input, a string such as the example below:

    For a full test report only the short summary, failures, errors etc. are of interest, therefore only this part is
    outputted, the rest is filtered. An example of such an output string is the following example:
