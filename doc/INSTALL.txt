How to install Odemis


= Installing the dependencies =

You need Ubuntu 12.04 (x86 - 32/64 bits). 
The dependencies can be found in the file debian/control. Basically, they can be
installed with:
sudo apt-get install python-imaging python-yaml python-serial python-zmq \
python-concurrent.futures python-scipy python-decorator cgroup-bin \
python-libtiff python-comedilib python-h5py \ # libhdf5-serial-1.8.4 \
libtiff4-dev \ # or libtiff5-dev
python-pkg-resources python-netifaces python-cairo python-numpy python-scipy \
python-decorator python-xdg python-suds python-matplotlib python-opencv \
python-wxgtk3.0 python-serial python-evdev python-libtiff python-notify \
graphicsmagick cgroup-bin python2-pyro4 authbind

Some of these packages need newer version than what is available in the default
Ubuntu repository. They can be found on Delmic's PPA, or it's possible to
install them from source.

To install the PPA:
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:delmic-soft/odemis

Otherwise, follow the instructions below.

== wxPython 3.0 ==

- Make sure the following dependencies are installed:
sudo apt-get install libgtk2.0-dev freeglut3 freeglut3-dev freeglut3-dbg libgl1-mesa-glx libglu1-mesa libgl1-mesa-dev libglu1-mesa-dev libgstreamer0.10-dev libgconf2-dev libsdl1.2-dev zlib1g-dev libjpeg-dev libtiff4-dev python-gst0.10-dev python-dev

Download wxPython 3.0 and untar:
wget http://downloads.sourceforge.net/wxpython/wxPython-src-3.0.1.1.tar.bz2
tar xf wxPython-src-3.0.1.1.tar.bz2

- Compile:
cd wxPython
sudo python2.7 build-wxpython.py --build_dir=../build --install

- *important!* Update library database:
sudo ldconfig

= H5Py 2.1 =
This is require to support DimensionScales.

sudo apt-get install libhdf5-serial-dev cython
git clone git://github.com/h5py/h5py.git
cd h5py
python api_gen.py
cd ..
python setup.py build
sudo python setup.py install

= Installing Comedi =
Used to access the DAQ board to connect to the SEM. The version of comedi
provided in Ubuntu 12.04 is version 0.8. It should work, but if not you can also
try to upgrade to 0.10. See below for the instructions. The driver is only
tested on the NI PCI 6251, and will only work on a NI board or the comedi_test simulator
(adaptation for other boards should be light, as long as Comedi support
synchronous input/output).

Once Comedi is installed. You need to calibrate the DAQ board (about once per year).

For the NI PCI 6251:
sudo comedi_soft_calibrate -f /dev/comedi0

For some other boards, which are calibrated in hardware, you need to do:
sudo comedi_calibrate -f /dev/comedi0

Warning: you probably want to ensure your kernel is >= 3.11 or has the following two
patches, otherwise it might crash:
http://article.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel.stable/57779/raw
http://article.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel.stable/57796/raw

== Installing comedilib 0.10.1 ==
Ubuntu 12.04 has a too old version of comedi (v 0.8). Version 0.10 or higher is required.
git clone git://comedi.org/git/comedi/comedilib.git
sudo apt-get install autoconf libltdl-dev flex byacc python-dev swig
cd comedilib
./autogen.sh
./configure
make -j
sudo make install

== Installing comedi_calibrate ==
git clone git://comedi.org/git/comedi/comedi_calibrate.git
sudo apt-get install libboost-dev libboost-program-options-dev libgsl0-dev
cd comedi_calibrate
./autogen.sh
./configure
make -j
sudo make install

== Loading the comedi simulator driver ==
Needs to be done after every boot.
sudo modprobe comedi comedi_num_legacy_minors=4
sudo modprobe comedi_test
sudo comedi_config /dev/comedi0 comedi_test 1000000,1000000

Note: if you use this simulator, you probably want to ensure you have a kernel >= 3.2.38 or
>= 3.5.7.4, as earlier versions are known to crash.

= Installing Odemis =

Download the source code:
cd ~/development
git clone git://github.com/delmic/Pyro4.git
git clone git://github.com/delmic/odemis.git

Create a "odemis" group and add all the necessary users to it:
sudo addgroup odemis
sudo adduser replace_by_login_name odemis

(You need to log out to get the user in the new group)

On Linux, install the files this way:
cd odemis
python ./setup.py build
sudo ./setup.py install --root=/ --install-scripts=/usr/local/bin/ --install-data=/usr/ --single-version-externally-managed

To get the fluorophores database, you can run this command:
./util/getfluodb.py
Then copy all the fluodb directory to /usr/share/odemis/fluodb/

= Installing the vendor device drivers =

== Andor Clara camera ==

Note that it's recommended to plug the USB cable to a separate USB hub (to
ensure full bandwidth availability). To check this you can use:
lsusb -t

- Install the driver:
  cd andor-2.97
  sudo ./install_andor  # Install "5 (All USB products)"

On Linux/Ubuntu you need to install libusb-dev (or have a link from libusb.so to
libusb-0.1.so.4).

Also the the permissions of all the files must be allowed for normal user:
everything is installed by default as root only, so nothing can work from the
normal user account. See /usr/local/*/*andor*
TODO: come up with a nice command to change the owner of those files.
Finally, fix /etc/udev/rules.d/andor.rules to read as:
ATTRS{idVendor}=="136e", MODE="0666"

For example:
sudo gedit /etc/udev/rules.d/andor.rules
# add the line and save the file
sudo udevadm control --reload-rules


== Andor Neo camera (used for camera simulator too) ==

- Install Andor SDK v3.7

On Linux, the bitflow driver has to be reinstalled (recompiled) each time the
kernel is updated. Note that it is only required if you are using the real camera,
the simulator doesn't need this module.

== Princeton Instruments PVCam cameras ==
Pixis and cameras connected via a ST133 controller are supported (only via USB connection).

The official driver is not working on new Linux kernels (> 2.6.31). You need to get the
updated driver version.
Either install pvcam-pilk-usb-dkms_1.0.3-1ubuntu1_all.deb:
sudo apt-get install dkms
sudo dpkg -i pvcam-pilk-usb-dkms_1.0.3-1ubuntu1_all.deb

Or install it from source (needs to be recompiled after each kernel update):
git clone https://github.com/delmic/pvcam-pilk.git
cd pvcam-pilk/usb
make
sudo cp rspiusb.ko /lib/modules/$(uname -r)/updates/
sudo depmod

Note that the driver seems to not always work with USB3 ("SS"), so make sure
the camera is connected to a USB2 slot. Also, it doesn't always work when
plugged via a hub. So ensure that it is connected on USB plug directly linked
to the motherboard. Use "lsusb -t" to check, and avoid the front panel USB
plugs in general.

Then install the libpvcam library from PI, as can be found on their site:
wget ftp://ftp.piacton.com/Public/Software/Official/Linux/libpvcam.so.2.7.4.2
sudo cp libpvcam.so.2.7.4.2 /usr/lib
sudo ln -s libpvcam.so.2.7.4.2 /usr/lib/libpvcam.so

== Physik Instrumente C-170 (Redstone) piezo-motor controllers ==

Nothing specific. Make sure that the normal user has permissions to access the
serial port. For example, if it is a USB serial port adapter check the
permissions of /dev/ttyUSB0. Typically, you need to do this:
sudo adduser replace_by_login_name dialout

For Linux: make sure you copy the content of install/linux/ to / and run:
sudo udevadm control --reload-rules

== Physik Instrumente E-861 piezo-motor controllers ==

Nothing specific. Plug one via the USB cable to the computer and the other ones
in daisy chain to each other. At least one of the controller must have address
1.

For Linux: make sure you copy the content of install/linux/ to /:
sudo install install/linux/etc/udev/rules.d/99-pi-fixed.rules /etc/udev/rules.d/
and run:
sudo udevadm control --reload-rules

On old versions of Linux (before 3.2.7), you need to create a file
/etc/udev/rules.d/99-usbftdi.rules with:
SUBSYSTEMS=="usb", ATTRS{idProduct}=="1008", ATTRS{idVendor}=="1a72", RUN+="/sbin/modprobe -q ftdi-sio product=0x1008 vendor=0x1a72"

For newer versions of Linux, to force using a FTDI device, you need to do the following:
sudo modprobe ftdi-sio
sudo sh -c "echo 1a72 1008 > /sys/bus/usb-serial/drivers/ftdi_sio/new_id"

= Configuring the instantiation file =
This file describes the available hardware for Odemis. Basically, it lists for each
hardware, which driver to use and the parameters required. It's following the
YAML format (similar to JSON). See the back-end specification for precise syntax
and example files.

To get inspired when starting a new file, you can use "odemis-cli --scan" to
detect some of the hardware connected.

If you're using an SEM and another detector, it is recommended to first
configure the X/Y axes of the SEM to orient the image identically to the vendor
software, and then adjust the orientation of the other detectors.


= Auto start =
To avoid entering the password when starting and stopping the backend, sudo is used.
To allow users to completely avoid typing a password, you can copy the sudoers file:
sudo install -m 0440 install/linux/etc/sudoers.d/odemis /etc/sudoers.d/odemis
