    This represents the bare PI C-170 piezo motor controller (Redstone), the
    information comes from the manual C-170_User_MS133E104.pdf. Note that this
    controller uses only native commands, which are different from the "PI GCS",
    (general command set).

    From the device description:
    The distance and velocity travelled corresponds to the width, frequency and
    number of motor-on pulses. By varying the pulse width, the step length [...]
    the motor velocity can be controlled. As the mechanical environment
    also influences the motion, the size of single steps is not highly
    repeatable. For precise position control, a system with a position feedback
    device is recommended (closed-loop operation).
    Miniature-stages can achieve speeds of 500 mm/s and more with minimum
    incremental motion of 50 nm.
    :
    The smallest step a piezo motor can make is typically on the order of
    0.05 μm and corresponds to a 10 μs pulse (shorter pulses have no effect).

    In practice: if you give a too small duration to a step, it will not move
    at all. In experiments, 40~50µs for duration of a pulse is the minimum that
    moves the axis (of about 1µm). Note that it's not linear:
    50 µs  => 1µm
    255 µs => 8µm

    The controller has also many undocumented behaviour (bugs):
        * when doing a burst move at maximum frequency (wait == 0), it cannot be
          stopped
        * if you ask the status when it is waiting (WA, WS) it will fail to
          report status and enter error mode. Only a set command can recover
          it (SR? works).
        * HE returns a string which starts with 2 null characters.

    Here are all the commands the controller reports:
