# Uses a DAQ board with analog output accessed via the comedi interface to control
# an emitter power.
# This is designed for the USB-Dux board, but any comedi card with analog output
# should work.
# Note, with the USB-Dux D board, when the pwr_curve has voltages between 0->4 V,
# you should use pins 22->25 for channels 0->3  When the voltages are between
# -4 -> 4V, you should use pins 9->12.
