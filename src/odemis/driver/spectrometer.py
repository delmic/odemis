    '''
    A generic Detector which takes 2 dependencies to create a spectrometer. It's
    essentially a wrapper to a DigitalCamera to generate a spectrum as data
    from the DataFlow. Manipulation of the mirrors/gratings/prism must be done
    via the "spectrograph" dependency. On the contrary, access to the detector must
    be done only via this Component, and never directly on the "detector" dependency.

    The main differences between a Spectrometer and a normal DigitalCamera are:
     * the spectrometer data of the DataFlow has only one dimension (i.e., second
       dimension is fixed to 1)
     * the shape is the same as one of the DigitalCamera, but the second dim of
       max resolution is 1.
     * the maximum binning can be bigger than the maximum resolution (but not
       of the shape).
