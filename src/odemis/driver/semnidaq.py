# This is a module to drive a scanning electron microscope via the analog
# inputs. It uses a National Instrument (NI) Digital-Analog conversion and
# acquisition (DAQ) card on the computer side to control the X/Y position of the
# electron beam (e-beam), while receiving the intensity sent by the secondary
# electron and/or backscatter detector (or any other detector reporting a
# voltage). The DAQ card is controlled via the NI DAQmx driver and framework.
#
# Although it should in theory be quite generic, this driver is only tested on
# Ubuntu 20.04, with nidaqmx 0.7 and a NI PCIe 6361 DAQ card.
#
# From the point of view of Odemis, this driver provides several HwComponents.
# The e-beam position control is represented by an Scanner (Emitter) component,
# while each detector is represented by a separate Detector device.
#
# The pin connection is configurable, but it typically resembles this, on a NI PCIe 6361:
# Scanner X : AO0/AO GND = pins 22/55
# Scanner Y : AO1/AO GND = pins 21/54
# SED : AI1/AI GND = pins 33/32
# BSD : AI2/AI GND = pins 65/64
#
# To install the NI driver, here is a summarry of the commands needed:
# Download from https://www.ni.com/nl-nl/support/documentation/supplemental/18/downloading-and-installing-ni-driver-software-on-linux-desktop.html
# sudo apt install ./ni-ubuntu2004-drivers-stream.deb
# sudo apt update
# sudo apt install ni-daqmx ni-hwcfg-utility
# sudo dkms autoinstall
# pip3 install nidaqmx
#
# It's possible to simulate a specific card by obtaining a NCE file, adding
# "DevIsSimulated = 1" to the file content and running:
# nidaqmxconfig --import ni-pci6361-sim.nce --replace
#
# The documentation is found mostly in four places:
# * DAQ board documentation: X series user manual.pdf

    # Waveform generation:
    # The goal is to generate the position of the e-beam in X and Y for the given dwell time and
    # other settings. Essentially, it should have a fast dimension scan (typically X) and a slow
    # dimension (Y). We use the standard scan left->right and top->bottom. At the end of each
    # line the beam has to "flyback" quickly back to beginning of the next line. It needs a bit
    # of time to reach other side and "settle" there. That exact time depends on the SEM
    # characteristics and is defined by the "settle time". (That could be avoided by using the
    # so-called "zigzag" pattern, but such pattern has the tendency to have slight misalignment
    # between the odd (left->right) and even (right-> left) lines which gives a sort of
    # "interlacing effect" so it's usually not used for imaging). So the X and Y waveforms look
    # like a sawtooth (amplitude vs time):

    # ways to handle the flyback signal. The most basic way is to just repeat the first position
    # for the entire settle time. This is what we currently do. On the opposite size, a fancy way
    # can be to decompose into two parts. One part before the linear increase, which is already a
    # linear increase, but below the starting point. The second part is a smoothstep function
    # (which has no strong derivative) going from the right to the left point. The advantage of
    # the first part is to allow the beam to acquire the right "speed". It also avoids the first
    # pixel to be exposed more than the rest of the pixels (which can be noticeable in the
    # image). The main drawback with this approach is that it can expose the area just left to
    # the image area.
    #
    # Simultaneously there are signals to indicate the different states of the scanning. Firstly,
    # there is the "scanning" signal which is active every time the scan is active, even a little
    # before and after (to give time to the SEM to react to it, and avoid switching if a new
    # acquisition follows). There are three more status signals: pixel, line, and frame. The
    # pixel signal goes active when the beam moves to a new pixel. The line and frame signal go
    # active for respectively the whole line and frame. So they look like:
