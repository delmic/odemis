#pylint: disable=E1101
# This is a module to drive a FEI Scanning electron microscope via the so-called
# "external X/Y" line. It uses a DA-conversion and acquisition (DAQ) card on the
# computer side to control the X/Y position of the electron beam (e-beam), while
# receiving the intensity sent by the secondary electron and/or backscatter
# detector. The DAQ card is handled via the (Linux) Comedi interface.
#
# Although it should in theory be quite generic, this driver is only tested on
# Linux with Comedilib 0.10.1, with a NI PCI 6251 DAQ card, and a FEI Quanta SEM.
#
# From the point of view of Odemis, this driver provides several HwComponents.
# The e-beam position control is represented by an Scanner (Emitter) component,
# while each detector is represented by a separate Detector device.
#
# The pin connection should be the following for the NI PCI 6251:
# Scanner X : AO0/AO GND = pins 22/55
# Scanner Y : AO1/AO GND = pins 21/54
# SED : AI1/AI GND = pins 33/32
# BSD : AI2/AI GND = pins 65/64
# SCB-68 Temperature Sensor differential : AI0+/AI0- = AI0/AI8 = pins 68/34 (by jumper)
#
# Over-sampling consists in measuring the value multiple times for the same pixel.
# It is followed by "decimation", which aggregates the data back into just one
# pixel (the simplest and most usual technique being averaging).
# For SEM, this is necessary to acquire good quality picture as otherwise the
# sampling is done only during a very short period. This is the purpose of
# increasing the dwell time: to have a longer period to allow multiple samples
# to be acquired. It can be done either by keeping the e-beam on the same place
# and taking multiple samples, or moving the e-beam around the pixel (in which
# it's exactly equivalent to reducing the image resolution).
#
# Note about using comedi in Python:
# There are two available bindings for comedi in Python: python-comedilib
# (provided with comedi) and pycomedi.  python-comedilib provides just a direct
# mapping of the C functions. It's quite verbose because every name starts with
# comedi_ (not anymore in the latest version), and not object oriented.
# You can directly use the C documentation. The
# only thing to know is that parameters which are a simple type and used as output
# (e.g., int *, double *) are not passed as parameters but directly returned as
# output. However structures must be first allocated and then given as input
# parameter. See comedi_wrap.doc for parameters. It also uses special "unbounded
# arrays" for the instructions and sampl arrays, which are very inconvenient to
# manipulate. To create a structure, you need to create an object with the name
# of the structure, plus _struct.
# pycomedi is object-oriented. It tries to be less verbose but fails a bit
# because each object is in a separate module. At least it handles call errors
# as exceptions. It also has some non implemented parts, for example to_phys,
# from_phys are not available. For now there is no documentation but some
# examples.
# We ended up with using our own wrapper "comedi_simple". It's actually just a
# wrapper of python-comedilib to remove the "comedi_" part of each function, and
# generate the right exception in case of errors.
#
# TODO: the entire code should be reorganised. We should have a low-level
# component (running in its own thread) which keeps scanning (it could stop as
# merely an optimisation). Next to it, a high-level component should decide the
# scanning area, period and channels, and interface with the rest of Odemis.
# Communication between both component is only via queues.

        # It will hopefully be backported, at least onto 3.17+.

        # Counters and pulse generators are fairly different in terms of
        # functionality, but they correspond to similar devices seen as input
        # or output. When generalising, these devices are both referred to as
        # "counters".
        # A counter is made of the following basic elements:
        # * Input source: the signal measured or the clock of the pulse generation
        # * Gate: controls when the counting (or sampling) occurs
        # * Register: holds the current count
        # * Out: for the output counters (pulse generators), the output signal

        # On the NI board, the counters are defined by:
        # There are different ways to count (eg, counting up or down, on
        # the edge rising or lowering).
        # We use up counting on edge rising. In comedi,
        # this is specified via the comedi_set_counter_mode(). The "source"
        # is the input signal which is observed. The standard input for the first
        # counter is PFI 8, and for the second counter is PFI 3. This can be
        # changed using comedi_set_clock_source(...NI_GPCT_PFI_CLOCK_SRC_BITS(N), 0)
        # (note, it is called "clock" because for pulse generators this input
        # signal is what defines the
        # Typically, it has an initial value (which we set at 0), and after
        # being "armed" (which we only do via software with comedi_arm(),
        # TODO or via the AI start signal?), the value is increased every time an edge is detected.
        # When it is buffered, after each rising edge of the "sample clock", the
        # current value is copied into memory (TODO: how is this done? NI docs
        # seems to indicate for buffered counting the gate is used to carry the
        # sampling clock).
        # Note that the counter can overflow (after maxdata).
        # In buffer mode, it is cumulative by default, and can be reset by setting
        # the mode to NI_GPCT_LOADING_ON_GATE_BIT.
        # In buffered counting, the sampling clock is the (first) gate.
        # Note that in direct counting, the gate is used to "pause". The counter
        # only increases when the "gate" input is high.
        # Selection of the signal for the sampling clock is therefore done via
        # comedi_set_gate_source(), where in practice only the first gate (0) is
        # used.

        # Also, note that the comedi subdevice provides 3 channels. Pretty much
        # only channel 0 is used. Channels 1 and 2 are only meaningful to write
        # data, which corresponds to load A and B registers, which are not used
        # in edge counting.

        # "Routing" allows to configure which signal corresponds to a PFI.
        # It's a bit confusing, because it seems you can route a PFI to many
        # different output or input, but at the same time, the board has some
        # physical connections called PFIx (and P1/2.x).
        # You can either use a PFI as input and route it to be used as a
        # specific internal signal. For instance you can ask AI scan signal/event
        # (AI_START2) to be driven by the signal received on pin PFI2. This is
        # called "input" routing.
        # You can also ask a specific PFI to "export" an internal signal/event.
        # For instance you can ask to have the AO scan signal to be sent to pin
        # PFI4. This is called "output" routing.
        # It's also possible to do both simultaneously on a same PFI pin. In that
        # case you can connect two internal signals together (and also export)
        # the signals to a pin. For instance, you can output AO scan signal to
        # PFI4, and use PFI4 for AI scan signal, in which case AI scan will be
        # driven by the AO scan signal.
        # Output routing is done via comedi_set_routing()

        #              subdevice: the special PFI DIO subdevice (== 7)
        # this means (for output): source S (signal) goes to channel T (terminal)
        # Note that if you also need to configure the PFI pin correctly with the
        # special PFI DIO subdevice (7) and comedi_dio_config(...PFI number, COMEDI_OUTPUT)
        # For input routing, it's fairly implicit, by using a PFI when selecting
        # an signal (for instance, in set_clock_source() with NI_GPCT_PFI_CLOCK_SRC_BITS())
        #
        # The NI 660x documentation adds:
        # "You can export the CtrNSource signal to the I/O connector’s default PFI
        # input for each CtrNSource. For example, you can export the Ctr0Source
        # signal to the PFI 39/CTR 0 SRC pin, even if another PFI is inputting
        # the Ctr0Source signal."
        # NI's naming is confusing because they use the same name for the
        # _terminals_ (ie, physical input or output pins) and for the _signal_
        # (ie, the logical information that controls/indicates a specific behaviour).
        # Moreover, the routing idea consists in connecting 2 terminals, but
        # usually one of the terminals is implied (from the name).

        # more complex tricks:
        # The hardware triggers a "data stale" if no pulse between two
        # clock sampling signal (aka gate). However, it's only in noncumulative
        # mode, it doesn't happen in cumulative mode.
        #
        # TC: stands for terminal counter, and it's a signal set when the counter
        # rolls over (in order to detect it, and maybe increment another counter).
