    Represents one PVCam camera and provides all the basic interfaces typical of
    a CCD/CMOS camera.
    This implementation is for the Roper/PI/Photometrics PVCam library... or at
    least for the PI version.

    This is tested on Linux with SDK 2.7, using the documentation found here:
    ftp://ftp.piacton.com/Public/Manuals/Princeton%20Instruments/PVCAM%202.7%20Software%20User%20Manual.pdf

    Be aware that the library resets almost all the values to their default
    values after initialisation. The library doesn't call the dimensions
    horizontal/vertical but serial/parallel (because the camera could be rotated).
    But we stick to: horizontal = serial (max = width - 1)
                     vertical = parallel (max = height - 1)

    Here area few more non-obvious requirements given by the PI technical
    support:
    * PIXIS, must allocate an even number of frame buffers.
    * One must not turn off or disconnect the camera with the camera open.
    * One must not call other PVCAM parameters such as PARAM_TEMP to get the
     current temperature during data collection. Only functions or parameters
     designated as 'online' may be called.
    * Order dependency issue: can't turn on continuous clean before external
     sync (strobed mode) is enabled.
    * InGaAs camera cannot do hardware binning

    It offers mostly a couple of VigilantAttributes to modify the settings, and a
    DataFlow to get one or several images from the camera.

    It also provides low-level methods corresponding to the SDK functions.
