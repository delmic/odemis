            <li>At all time limit the pixel intensity to max. 1000 cts.</li>
            <li>Blank or turn off the e-beam.</li>
            <li>Close the shutter and the slit of the streak camera, then move the streak camera backwards.</li>
            <li>Put the camera in focus mode (unchecked).</li>
            <li>Open the shutter and carefully open the slit until the signal is visible in the displayed live view.</li>
            <li>Adjust the rotation and height of the slit such that the complete photocathode is illuminated.</li>
            <li>Adjust the focus ring of the input optics to maximize the pixel intensity.</li>
            <li>Close the slit and move the streak camera back against the SPARC.</li>
            <li>Turn on the calibration light and close the slit of the spectrograph by toggling the manual
                focus button.
                Open the slit of the streak camera to get the signal in live view. Maximize the intensity
                by moving the focus of the spectrograph manually.</li>
            <li>Adjust the spectrograph detector offset by adjusting the offset value based on the horizontal
                position of the spot on the displayed image (change offset using shrkconfig commands in terminal).
                The spot should be centered on the horizontal wavelength axis. Turn the calibration light off by
                untoggling the manual focus button.</li>
            <li>Optional: Perform a fine spectral calibration by toggling the manual focus button,
                selecting a grating and setting the center wavelength. Position the peaks of the calibration
                light (Ar) using the shrkconfig commands in the terminal (see manual: Ar spectrum).</li>
            <li>Turn on the e-beam and find the CL spot by adjusting the height of the streak camera with
                the lab-jack.</li>
            <li>Select the magnification corresponding to the input optics of the camera
                in the streak tab.</li>

            <li>Switch on the streak mode (checked).</li>
            <li>Optimize the MCP-Gain and the exposure time until the signal (a spot) is sufficient.</li>
            <li>Choose a smaller time range if multiple spots are visible.</li>
            <li>Center the line by adjusting the trigger delay.</li>
            <li>Perform the same procedure for all higher zoom levels.  </li> <!--Hack: empty space to avoid not empty line-->
            <li>Save the calibration file specifying the e-beam voltage.</li>
