    Basically, its "input" is a StreamTree and it can request stage and focus
    move. It never computes the composited image from all the streams itself.
    It's up to other objects (e.g., the canvas) to ask the StreamTree for its
    latest image (the main goal of this scheme is to avoid computation when not
    needed). Similarly, the thumbnail is never automatically recomputed, but
