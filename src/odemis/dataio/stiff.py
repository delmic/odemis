    Write a collection of multiple OME-TIFF files with the given images and

    filename (unicode): filename of the file to create (including path)
    data (list of model.DataArray, or model.DataArray): the data to export.
       Metadata is taken directly from the DA object. If it's a list, a multiple
       files distribution is created.
    thumbnail (None or numpy.array): Image used as thumbnail for the first file.
      Can be of any (reasonable) size. Must be either 2D array (greyscale) or 3D
      with last dimension of length 3 (RGB). If the exporter doesn't support it,
      it will be dropped silently.
    compressed (boolean): whether the file is compressed or not.
