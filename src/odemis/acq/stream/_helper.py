        # size changes, one (or more) other VA is updated to keep everything

        # must also be satisfied. The main rules followed are:
        #  * Try to keep the VA which was changed (by the user) as close as
        #    possible to the requested value (within hardware limits).

        #    least, try to keep the same center, and same area.

        #    and acceptable by the hardware.
