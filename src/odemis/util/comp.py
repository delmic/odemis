# The pixel size is defined differently for scanners and digital cameras:
# * scanner: the .pixelSize VA is just what we need, (it's updated whenever
#  the magnification changes). MD_PIXEL_SIZE, if presents, is similar to the
#  camera, as it's the size for the given scale.
# * camera:  MD_PIXEL_SIZE contains the pixel size, considering the binning.
#  .pixelSize contains the sensor pixel size (so not including the magnification.
