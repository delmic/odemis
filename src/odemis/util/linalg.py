def tri_inv(c, lower=False, unit_diagonal=False, overwrite_c=False,

    """
    Compute the inverse of a triangular matrix.

    Parameters
    ----------
    c : array_like
        A triangular matrix to be inverted
    lower : bool, optional
        Use only data contained in the lower triangle of `c`.
        Default is to use upper triangle.
    unit_diagonal : bool, optional
        If True, diagonal elements of `c` are assumed to be 1 and
        will not be referenced.
    overwrite_c : bool, optional
        Allow overwriting data in `c` (may improve performance).
    check_finite : bool, optional
        Whether to check that the input matrix contains only finite numbers.
        Disabling may give a performance gain, but may result in problems
        (crashes, non-termination) if the inputs do contain infinities or NaNs.

    Returns
    -------
    inv_c : ndarray
        Inverse of the matrix `c`.

    Raises
    ------
    LinAlgError
        If `c` is singular
    ValueError
        If `c` is not square, or not 2-dimensional.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> c = numpy.array([(1., 2.), (0., 4.)])
    >>> tri_inv(c)
    array([[ 1.  , -0.5 ],
           [ 0.  ,  0.25]])
    >>> numpy.dot(c, tri_inv(c))
