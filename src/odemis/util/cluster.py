cluster.py : backport of k-means++ initialisation method

The SciPy version available via default package managment of Ubuntu 18.04 LTS
is v0.19.1, which is quite old and lacks new features. This file backports the
k-means++ initialisation method for scipy.cluster.vq.kmeans2() which is
available from SciPy v1.2.0 onwards. When support for Ubuntu 18.04 LTS is no
longer required, this file can be removed.

    Picks k points in the data based on the kmeans++ method.

    Parameters
    ----------
    data : ndarray
        Expect a rank 1 or 2 array. Rank 1 is assumed to describe 1-D
        data, rank 2 multidimensional data, in which case one
        row is one observation.
    k : int
        Number of samples to generate.
    rng : `numpy.random.Generator` or `numpy.random.RandomState`
        Random number generator.

    Returns
    -------
    init : ndarray
        A 'k' by 'N' containing the initial centroids.
