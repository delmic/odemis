    - Basic support for Omicron xX laser sources
    - Developer documentation
    - Auto-completion of odemis-cli arguments
  * Main bug fixed:
    - Support SEM dwell times > 0.8s (now arbitrarily limited to < 100s)
    - Automatic button in dichotomy-based lens alignment moves to the right direction
    - Improved High Quality preset in SECOM acquisition
    - Image with all values at the maximum displays white (instead of black)
    - Keep the region of acquisition proportional when changing SEM magnification (SPARC)
    - Limit log of backend to 500 Mb
    - Stable SEM/CCD synchronised acquisition with improved time estimation
