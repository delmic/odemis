This is a script to acquire a set of EM/FM overlays over a long period.

run as:
./scripts/timelapse-secom.py -n 12 --period 60 --output filename-.tiff

-n defines the number of images to acquire.
   Don't set it to make it infinite, in which case you can stop with Ctrl+C.
--period defines the time between each acquisition
--output indicates the pattern of the filename which will contain all the output.
    It should finish by .h5 (for HDF5) or .tiff (for TIFF).

You first need to run the Odemis backend with the SECOM config. For instance,
start Odemis, and close the graphical interface. Alternatively you can start
just the back-end with a command such as:
odemisd --log-level 2 /usr/share/odemis/secom.odm.yaml

The configuration used is the settings of the hardware just _before_ starting
the scripts. Some of them can be updated while running, but it will not work
with all of them.
