# ETD detectors: I do not really know the actual voltage from the SEM:s. On the 250 we use a Keithley 427 as a filter and that gives a signal of 0 to -10V. With inverted contrast so that White is -10V. I have not checked the signal out from the 440. I will try that this week.

# The photon counter has a a pre amplifier and a photon counter/discriminator and generates TTL pulses. I will try to have a look at the counter itself.
